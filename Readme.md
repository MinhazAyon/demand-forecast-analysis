## Project Overview

# **Project Overview**

Large-scale supply chains have long operated across extensive product portfolios and multiple distribution locations, often under conditions of demand variability, long replenishment lead times, and uneven demand concentration. Historical demand data from such environments typically exhibits a wide range of behaviors, including stable consumption patterns, intermittent ordering, and highly erratic demand driven by operational or market factors.

These characteristics pose challenges for traditional forecasting approaches, particularly when rare but high-impact demand events dominate overall error and inventory risk. As a result, effective planning requires not only estimating expected demand levels, but also understanding and managing the uncertainty inherent in historical demand patterns.

This project analyzes historical demand data from a multi-product, multi-warehouse supply chain and develops a structured forecasting and planning framework that explicitly accounts for demand heterogeneity and uncertainty.

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to design a robust demand forecasting and inventory planning framework using historical data by:

- Identifying and segmenting products based on demand frequency and volatility.

- Estimating baseline demand for products with sufficient historical signal.

- Quantifying uncertainty associated with intermittent and erratic demand patterns.

- Applying appropriate forecasting methods for different demand regimes.

- Supporting inventory planning decisions through uncertainty-aware forecast outputs

The framework is designed to be applicable to historical supply chain datasets and emphasizes interpretability and practical decision support rather than reliance on real-time or external data sources.

**Challenges and Constraints**

The historical demand data presents several inherent challenges. Demand is highly intermittent and unevenly distributed across products, with a small subset of items accounting for the majority of total volume and variability. Many demand spikes appear irregular and are likely driven by operational or policy-related factors that are not explicitly recorded in the dataset. Additionally, the absence of external explanatory variables limits the ability of purely data-driven models to anticipate rare but high-impact demand events. These characteristics introduce irreducible uncertainty that must be addressed through both forecasting and inventory planning strategies.
